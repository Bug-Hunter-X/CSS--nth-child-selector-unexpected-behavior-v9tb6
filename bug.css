The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `:nth-child` pseudo-class.  The goal is to style every other list item starting from the second item. However, the code contains a common mistake that causes unexpected behavior. 

```css
li:nth-child(2n) {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

This CSS only styles even-numbered children. To style every other element *starting from the second*, you must use `2n+1`.
